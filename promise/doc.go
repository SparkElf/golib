//Package promise provides a simple,fast and semantic promise and async/await implementation.
//In addition to the basic promise syntax,it also provides parameter settings such as timeout.
//The implementation based on scheduler and soft interrupt allows you to control each stage of the
//workflow,rather than leaving sub thread out of control after it starts.
